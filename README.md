# Birds-Acoustics-Identifier-Model

## **Overview**
The Bird Sound Identifier is a deep learning-based project that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify bird species based on their audio recordings. The project processes bird sound data by extracting mel spectrograms from audio files and trains a model to accurately identify species.

---

## **Features**
- Extracts mel spectrogram features from audio recordings using `librosa`.
- Trains a CNN model to classify bird species.
- Provides a detailed evaluation through classification reports and confusion matrices.
- Saves the trained model for future use.

---

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `librosa`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `tensorflow`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
